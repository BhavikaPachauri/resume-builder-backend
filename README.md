## ðŸ¤– AI Logic (Brief)

- **Resume Keyword Extraction:**
  - Uses the `natural` NLP library to tokenize and stem resume text and job descriptions.
  - Extracted keywords are stored and used for AI-powered matching.

- **AI Matching & Fit %:**
  - When an employer searches, the backend compares job description keywords and required skills to each candidateâ€™s profile.
  - Calculates a fit percentage based on skill overlap and keyword overlap (weighted formula).
